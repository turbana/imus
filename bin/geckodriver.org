* Building for ARM (raspberrypi)
Mozilla stopped releasing ARM builds in 2018, so we need to checkout the mozilla
repo and cross-compile to ARM in order to run selenium on a raspberrypi. I
followed the directions [[https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/testing/geckodriver/ARM.html][here]], with one exception:

In file =testing/geckodriver/Cargo.toml=:
#+BEGIN
Change line 24 from:
    regex = { version="1.0", default-features = false, features = ["perf", "std"] }
to:
     regex = "1"
#+END
